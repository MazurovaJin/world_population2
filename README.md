# world_population2

I’ll work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. I’ll write queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

There are two tables:
**countries**
| Column | Type |	Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| id     |INTEGER| Primary key|
| name   | Text  | 
| continent| Text|

**population_years**
| Column| Type| Notes|
| id    | INTEGER| Primary Key|
| population| NUMBER | (in millions)
|
